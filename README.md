# Algorithms and Data Structures in Java

## Overview:

Welcome to the Algorithms and Data Structures repository! This collection contains Java implementations and test cases for various algorithms and data structures encountered during my academic studies and self-directed learning.

## Project Structure:

- `src/`: This directory contains the Java source code for the implemented algorithms and data structures.
- `test/`: Here, you'll find test cases to validate the functionality of the implemented code.
- `docs/`: Documentation related to the algorithms and their usage.

## Getting Started:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mclovin108/algorithms.git
   ```

2. **Explore the Code:**
   - Navigate to the `src/` directory to view the Java implementations.
   - Check the `test/` directory for test cases.

3. **Run Tests:**
   - Execute the test cases to ensure the correctness of the implemented algorithms.
